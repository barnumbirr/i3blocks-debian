i3blocks (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Fix d/watch file so it reports accurate versions
  * d/control: set Architecture to linux-any, kfreebsd-any. It does not build
    on GNU/Hurd, as it makes use of a lot of macros that are undefined.
  * Use the github tagged release tarball (as it contains non-generated manual
    pages)
  * Add ruby-ronn as build-dependency (to generate the manual page)
  * Fix broken Recommends fields on some architectures:
    + acpi is now: [amd64 i386 mipsel]
    + alsa-utils and sysstat are now: [linux-any]
